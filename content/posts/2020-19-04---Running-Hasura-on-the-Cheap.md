## What's Hasura?

[Hasura](https://hasura.io/) is the company that created the [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://github.com/hasura/graphql-engine#hasura-graphql-engine), a "blazing-fast GraphQL server that gives you instant, realtime GraphQL APIs over Postgres." (For this blog post, I may use "Hasura" and "Hasura GraphQL Engine" interchangeably because this post is about self-hosting their GraphQL engine. But Hasura the company offers more than just their GraphQL engine.)

![Hasura Landing Page](/media/hasura-landing.png)

You can use the Hasura GUI to create Postgres tables and easily do standard Postgres things like set:
* columns
* constraints
* primary/foreign/unique keys
* table relationships

![Table Relationships in Hasura](/media/hasura-table-relationships.png)

All this data is then accessible through a single GraphQL endpoint. You can use the integrated [GraphiQL IDE](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql#overview) to write queries, mutations, and subscriptions. 

![GraphiQL in Hasura](/media/graphiql.png)

Additionally, there are more advanced features like [permissioning](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/auth/authorization/permission-rules.html), [custom SQL functions](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/databases/postgres/schema/custom-functions.html), and [event triggers](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/event-triggers/index.html). Beyond their documentation, many of these topics are covered in [their extremely handy tutorials](https://hasura.io/learn/).

I've been building [Trivia.Digital](https://trivia.digital) with Hasura as my backend, and it's made it very simple to configure my database and make my data accessible over a real-time GraphQL API. It's [open-source](https://hasura.io/opensource/) and has [great documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/index.html) and I highly recommend it! As a relative noob to both Postgres and GraphQL, its UI is more beginner-friendly than a tool like [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) (though I've heard many great things about PostGraphile).

The biggest _potential_ downside of Hasura is that it can be relatively expensive for a hobbyist to use it for a side project. But it doesn't have to be that way! Because their GraphQL Engine is open-source, I've been running it on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for just $5/month.

**This post explains how you, too, can run Hasura for $5/month while avoiding some potential pitfalls.** _Caveat_: I am not an expert on any of these topics, so my apologies if I've gotten anything wrong. If you have any suggestions, please email me at bhollander823@gmail.com.

Of course, this low bill is only possible because so many companies offer free plans for small projects. A _huge_ thank you to all of these companies for making their tools so accessible.

## Self-Hosting Hasura GraphQL Engine on DigitalOcean

While the [free tier of Hasura Cloud](https://hasura.io/pricing/) is perfect for development, you are limited to 60 requests/minute. That's _probably_ not going to be enough for a production app. To get unlimited requests, you need to upgrade to the Standard tier which starts at $99/month. Because my site is more of a hobby project, I sought out a cheaper way to run my project in production.

Helpfully, Hasura has documentation on how to [easily deploy their GraphQL Engine](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/digital-ocean-one-click.html) to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), where a virtual machine with 1 GB memory and 25 GB disk will run you $5/month. Seems like a good deal to me! 


## Hosting a Postgres Database on Heroku

Hasura additionally has a guide to [creating a DigitalOcean managed Postgres database](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/deployment/deployment-guides/digital-ocean-one-click.html#using-digitalocean-managed-postgres-database). But those start at a comparatively steep $15/month.

Thankfully, it's incredibly easy to create a free database hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) when you create a new Hasura project. For the low price of free, you can store up to 1 GB across 10k rows. For $9/month, your storage limit dramatically increases to 10 GB across ten million rows.

![Create Heroku Database](/media/create-heroku-database.png)

You might now be thinking, "If I'm going to host my database on Heroku, why don't I just host Hasura GraphQL Engine on Heroku too?" Well, the approximate Heroku equivalent of a [DigitalOcean Droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/) is called a "[dyno](https://www.heroku.com/dynos)," and a dyno that doesn't auto-sleep starts at $7/month. So a dyno is generally a bit more expensive than the Droplet-equivalent. Still, Heroku is a "Platform as a Service" while DigitalOcean is "Infrastructure as a Service", so Heroku _does_ offer you additional features for your money if you choose to go that route.

## The Biggest Issue With These Hosting Choices

**The biggest downside to this approach is that you must manually sync your Heroku database URL with your self-hosted Hasura GraphQL Engine.** Before I implemented what I describe below, **my site was unusable after Heroku maintenance**.

### Why You Need This

There is own major downside to a free Heroku database: maintenance. After maintenance, _your database credentials change_. So, _you must_ update your database credentials in your self-hosted Hasura GraphQL Engine so your app can continue to connect to your database.

<img src="/media/heroku-maintenance-email.png" alt="Heroku Maintenance Notice" width=350 />

Hasura Cloud offers "[Heroku URL Sync](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/cloud/projects/heroku-url-sync.html)" to keep your project's `HEROKU_DATABASE_URL` in sync. Unfortunately, this feature is only available for Hasura Cloud users. *Fortunately*, I'm about to tell you how to build this feature for your self-hosted Hasura GraphQL Engine. If all goes well, this should take you less than an hour. If it goes _really_ well, it might only take you 15 minutes. All code below is [also available on GitHub](https://github.com/byrnehollander/run-hasura-cheaply).

### 1. Create a Webhook Server

[Webhooks](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/) are a way for apps to send automated messages to other apps. In this case, **we want Heroku to tell us when our database credentials change** so we can update them in our GraphQL Engine.

Adnan Hajdarević's open-source [webhook](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook#what-is-webhook-) tool makes it easy to spin-up a server that will receive event notifications via webhook. Your Droplet is probably running Ubuntu 18+, so after [SSH'ing into your Droplet](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/connect-with-ssh/), you can install `webhook` with the following command:

`sudo apt-get install webhook`

Once `webhook` is installed, you'll need to create a configuration file that defines the hooks that `webhook` will serve.

Here's what my `hooks.json` file looks like (except with correct paths, of course):

```JSON
[
    {
        "id": "redeploy-webhook",
        "execute-command": "/path/to/redeploy.sh",
        "command-working-directory": "/path/to/folder/with/docker-compose.yaml"
    }
]
```

When the webhook receives the new Heroku release event (we'll get to that in the next section!) it executes the `redeploy.sh` script in the directory with our `docker-compose.yaml` file. Note that we don't actually care about the event payload – we only care about knowing that something has changed with our Heroku database's configuration and then running our script.

Our script will fetch the new database URL from Heroku and parse the database password from the URL. It'll then update our `.env` file with these new values. Finally, it will restart the Docker containers.

Here's what the `redeploy.sh` bash script looks like (make sure it's excecutable by running `chmod +x redeploy.sh`):

```Shell
#!/bin/sh
URL=$(heroku config:get DATABASE_URL -a YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME)
PW=$(echo $URL | grep -Po "[a-zA-Z0-9]+?(?=@)")
echo "DATABASE_URI=$URL\nDATABASE_PASSWORD=$PW" > .env
docker-compose restart
```

Before this script will work, we need to install the Heroku CLI and authenticate ourselves. We can do this on Ubuntu with the following command:

`sudo snap install --classic heroku`

Then, run:

`heroku login -i`

and enter your login credentials. You'll also need to replace `YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME` in `redeploy.sh` with the name of the app that has the `Heroku Postgres` add-on installed. You can use the Heroku CLI to get a list of all your Heroku apps by running `heroku apps`.

Next, start the webhook server with the following command (be sure to replace `your-domain.com` with an address associated with the Droplet you've SSH'd into):

```
webhook -hooks /path/to/hooks.json -ip "your-domain.com" -port 9003
```

The hook is now available at http://your-domain.com:9003/hooks/redeploy-webhook

Note that I've chosen port `9003` arbitrarily – I cannot vouch for this port beyond that it functionally works for my application and it's not used by anything else. Also note that the webhook is currently using the insecure `http` protocol.

To upgrade to `https` you need to find some certs (more on this in a moment) and then run the following command:

```
webhook -hooks /path/to/hooks.json -secure -cert /path/to/public.crt -key path/to/private.key -ip "your-domain.com" -port 9003
```

After running this command, your hook will be available at https://your-domain.com:9003/hooks/redeploy-webhook – much better!

If you've deployed the Hasura GraphQL Engine with [the app on the DigitalOcean Marketplace](https://marketplace.digitalocean.com/apps/hasura-graphql), one of its dependencies – [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) – will automatically obtain and renew TLS certificates for you when you run `docker-compose up`. These certs are stored in a [Docker Volume](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/), so you can peek in there to either provide a path to them _or_ just copy them to a different directory. Do note that the `webhook` `-cert` flag expects a public key and the `-key` flag expects a private key. You can find [the full documentation on `webhook parameters` here](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/blob/master/docs/Webhook-Parameters.md).

You will need to be a bit careful not to restart the Docker containers _too_ often as it seems that Hasura's DigitalOcean Marketplace app isn't actually re-using TLS credentials across restarts; instead, it's regenerating new certs each time. And you're not going to have a great time if you run into [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)'s [rate-limit](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/rate-limits/). Addressing this may be a topic of a future blog post. Anyway, the takeaways should be: 1. Consider removing the `docker-compose restart` line from your `redeploy.sh` file while you're testing , and 2. You don't want to hit this webhook _too_ often.

One last tip: when you run the above `webhook` command, add an ` &` to the end of it so the command runs in the background – you don't want the server to stop after you've closed your shell session.

### 2. Configure docker-compose.yaml to Use Environment Variables

This step should be refreshingly straightforward! Instead of directly setting `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` in `docker-compose.yaml`, you should access their values from [environment variables](https://medium.com/chingu/an-introduction-to-environment-variables-and-how-to-use-them-f602f66d15fa). We already named these env vars in `redeploy.sh`, so you can reference them like so:

`POSTGRES_PASSWORD: "${DATABASE_PASSWORD}"`

and

`HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL: "${DATABASE_URI}"`

### 3. Tell Heroku About Your Webhook URL

We're in the home stretch!

Navigate to your Heroku app running your Postgres database. The URL will look something like https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/YOUR-HEROKU-APP-NAME

Then, click `More` in the top-right and then `View webhooks`.

<img src="/media/create-heroku-webhook-1-of-2.png" alt="Create Heroku Webhook 1 of 2" width=190 />

On the new page, click `Create Webhook`. Enter in your URL from before – in this case, https://your-domain.com:9003/hooks/redeploy-webhook – and only select the `api:release` event type. If you'd like to set a secret, refer to [the `webhook rules` documentation](https://github.com/adnanh/webhook/blob/master/docs/Hook-Rules.md).

<img src="/media/create-heroku-webhook-2-of-2.png" alt="Create Heroku Webhook 2 of 2" width=290 />

To test your setup, you can create a new config var in your Heroku app. To do this, navigate to the `Settings` tab in your Heroku app, click `Reveal Config Vars` and create a new key. It doesn't matter what you put in as the key name – we just want to create a new release so Heroku calls your webhook.

![Set Heroku Config Var](/media/heroku-set-config-var.png)

Hopefully, you're all set! You can double-check by navigating to the directory with your `docker-compose.yaml` file and seeing that the `.env` file matches your Heroku database credentials.

Now, any Heroku database maintenance will not be much of a problem for you or your app (except for a few seconds of downtime while the credentials are updated).
